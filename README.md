## Architecture Overview

### Frontend

- Vanilla JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3-no frameworks for maximum compatibility.
- Accessibility and senior-friendly design principles (large touch targets, high contrast, readable typography).
- Modules for shared config (`frontend/config.js`), plan logic (`frontend/meal-planning.js`), and tip personalization (`frontend/health-tips.js`).

### Backend (AWS Serverless)

- **recipes-api** - DynamoDB-backed recipe search and filter endpoints.
- **nutrition-match-api** - Ingredient parsing, density-aware conversions, synonym normalization, and per-serving calculations.
- **foods-api** - Food database lookups and nutrition metadata.
- Deployed via Lambda + API Gateway; data stored in DynamoDB tables (`Recipes_i2`, `Foods_v2`).
- Region: `ap-southeast-2` (Sydney, Australia)

### Database

- **AWS DynamoDB** (NoSQL database)
  - `Foods_v2` table: 10,000+ food items with nutritional data
  - `Recipes_i2` table: 1,000+ curated recipes with dietary tags
  - Both tables include Global Secondary Indexes (GSI) for fast prefix searches
  - See [backend/DATA_IMPORT_GUIDE.md](backend/DATA_IMPORT_GUIDE.md) for data import instructions

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Modern browser (Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+, Edge 90+).
- Network access for live recipe/nutrition APIs.

### Quick Start

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open `frontend/index.html` in a browser (local file or static host).
3. Enter the demo password `tp33` when prompted.
4. Explore additional modules (Meal Planning, Seasonal Produce, Daily Tips, etc.).

### Live Demo

Visit the deployed application at: [Silver Spoon Society](https://silverspoon-tp33.netlify.app)

### Local Development Notes

- Personalization data stores in `localStorage` under keys managed by `API_CONFIG.STORAGE_KEYS`.
- `frontend/data/` contains JSON data assets used across pages (e.g., seasonal produce, health tips).
- For backend development, refer to `backend/README.md` for Lambda deployment and scripts.

## Personalization & Data Flow

1. **Questionnaire Inputs** -> stored in `localStorage` (`mealPlanPreferences`).
2. **Meal Planning** -> fetches recipes via `recipes-api`, calculates nutrition through `nutrition-match-api`, updates dashboard and shopping list.
3. **Daily Tips** -> loads `data/health_tips.json`, filters by diet/allergies/meal preferences, uses date + refresh counter for stable randomness, and renders accessible cards.
4. **Dashboard Export** -> cached meal plans saved under `weeklyMealPlanForDashboard` for cross-page availability.
