# Technical Issues & Improvements

## 游댮 HIGH PRIORITY (Fix Immediately)

### Backend: Nutrition Calculation Accuracy
- **Issue**: Overly aggressive sodium adjustment logic may cause inaccurate nutrition values
  - Current: `if (n > 10000) n = n / 100` (divides by 100)
  - Current: `if (n > 5000) n = n / 20` (divides by 20)
- **Impact**: Nutrition values may be significantly underestimated
- **Fix**: Use more conservative adjustment thresholds
- **Priority**: 游댮 High (affects nutrition accuracy)

## 游리 MEDIUM PRIORITY (Important Improvements)

### Frontend: LocalStorage Error Handling
- **Issue**: localStorage operations missing try-catch blocks
- **Impact**: App crashes in privacy mode or when storage quota exceeded
- **Fix**: Create safe localStorage wrapper functions
- **Priority**: 游리 Medium

### Backend: Performance Optimization
- **Issue**: recipes-api uses table scan operations instead of GSI queries
- **Impact**: Slow response times for large datasets
- **Fix**: Implement GSI queries for title search optimization
- **Priority**: 游리 Medium


## 游릭 LOW PRIORITY (Nice to Have)

### Backend: Monitoring & Metrics
- **Issue**: No performance monitoring or error tracking
- **Fix**: Add CloudWatch metrics and error monitoring
- **Priority**: 游릭 Low

### Frontend: State Management
- **Issue**: Inconsistent state management across pages
- **Fix**: Implement centralized state management system
- **Priority**: 游릭 Low

### Backend: Caching Layer
- **Issue**: No caching for frequent queries
- **Fix**: Add Redis or DynamoDB DAX caching
- **Priority**: 游릭 Low

# Future Enhancements

## Pescatarian Diet Support
- **Feature**: Re-enable Pescatarian diet option when sufficient recipes are available
- **Current Status**: Temporarily disabled due to only 1 recipe in database
- **Implementation**:
  - Add more pescatarian recipes to the database (target: 50+ recipes)
  - Re-enable pescatarian option in frontend filters (explore-recipes.html, meal-planning.js)
  - Add pescatarian back to backend VALID_HABITS array
  - Update recipe tags and categorization for fish-based recipes
- **Benefits**: Better diet diversity and pescatarian user support
- **Priority**: Low (content expansion needed first)

## Allergic Ingredient Filtering
- **Feature**: Add functionality to filter out recipes containing ingredients that users are allergic to
- **Implementation**:
  - Add user allergy preferences to user profile/settings
  - Implement ingredient checking logic in meal planning algorithm
  - Filter recipes during meal plan generation based on allergic ingredients
  - Provide clear indication when recipes are excluded due to allergies
- **Benefits**: Improves user safety and personalization of meal plans
- **Priority**: Medium-High (safety feature)
