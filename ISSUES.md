## 🔴 HIGH PRIORITY (Fix Immediately)

### Backend: Recipe Search and Meal Plan Generation Performance

- **Issue**: Recipe search and meal plan generation are extremely slow (5-30 seconds)
- **Impact**: Poor user experience, timeouts, and user abandonment
- **Root Causes**:
  - **DynamoDB Scan Operations**: Using `ScanCommand` instead of `QueryCommand` for all searches
    - Title search scans up to 5,000 items (`MAX_SCAN_ITEMS: 5000`)
    - Category/habit filtering requires full table scan with client-side filtering
    - Multiple round trips with `PAGE_LIMIT: 100` per scan
  - **Missing Database Indexes**: Code comments indicate "GSI is not populated"
    - No Global Secondary Index (GSI) for title search
    - No GSI for categories, habits, or diet types
    - All filtering done on client-side after full scan
  - **Serial API Calls**: Meal plan generation makes sequential API calls
    - Separate recipe API call for each meal type (breakfast, lunch, dinner)
    - Multiple nutrition API calls processed serially
    - No request parallelization or batching
- **Performance Analysis**:
  | Operation | Current Time | Target Time | Improvement Needed |
  |-----------|--------------|-------------|-------------------|
  | Recipe Search | 5-15 seconds | 1-3 seconds | 80%+ reduction |
  | Meal Plan Generation | 15-30 seconds | 5-10 seconds | 65%+ reduction |
- **Proposed Solutions** (Priority Order):
  1. **🔴 Critical - Add DynamoDB GSI Indexes**:
     - `title-index`: Enable efficient title search with QueryCommand
     - `category-index`: Support category filtering via GSI
     - `habits-index`: Support diet type and habit filtering
     - `composite-index`: Enable multi-attribute queries
  2. **🟡 Medium - Frontend Request Optimization**:
     - Implement parallel API calls using `Promise.all()`
     - Add client-side caching with `Map()` or localStorage
     - Implement request debouncing for search inputs
  3. **🟢 Low - Backend API Batching**:
     - Create batch endpoints: `GET /recipes/batch?categories=breakfast,lunch,dinner`
     - Pre-compute popular meal plan combinations
     - Add pagination cursors for large result sets
  4. **🔵 Future - Caching Layer**:
     - CloudFront CDN for static recipe data
     - Redis cache for frequent queries
     - Pre-generated meal plan templates
- **Expected Impact**: 80%+ performance improvement with GSI implementation
- **Priority**: 🔴 Critical (affects core user experience)

### Frontend: Meal Plan Generation User Experience

- **Issue**: Users are blocked from navigating to other pages during meal plan generation
- **Impact**: Poor user experience - users must wait on a loading screen until generation completes
- **Current Behavior**:
  - Meal plan generation locks the UI with a loading spinner
  - Users cannot browse recipes, nutrition dashboard, or other features during generation
  - No notification when generation completes if user navigates away
- **Proposed Solution**:
  - Allow background meal plan generation with free navigation
  - Add notification system (popup + optional sound) when generation completes
  - Show mini progress indicator in navigation bar during generation
  - Provide "Return to Meal Plan" button in completion notification
- **Technical Implementation**:
  - Convert to Web Worker or async background task
  - Add global generation status tracking
  - Implement Browser Notification API or Toast notifications
  - Add Audio API for completion sound (with user preference toggle)
- **Priority**: 🔴 High (significantly improves user experience)

### Frontend: Recipe Ingredient Portion Display

- **Issue**: Multi-serving recipes show ingredient amounts for entire recipe instead of per-person portions
- **Impact**: Users see confusing ingredient quantities that don't match individual serving sizes
- **Current Behavior**:
  - Recipe ingredients list shows total amounts for all servings (e.g., "4 cups rice" for 4-person recipe)
  - Both meal-planning.html and explore-recipes.html display raw ingredient amounts from database
  - Users must manually calculate per-person portions for shopping or cooking
  - Inconsistent with nutrition information which is already shown per-serving
- **Expected Behavior**:
  - Ingredient amounts should be automatically calculated and displayed per person
  - Example: "4 cups rice (serves 4)" should display as "1 cup rice per person"
  - Consistent across both meal planning and recipe exploration interfaces
- **Technical Implementation**:
  - Parse ingredient text to extract quantities (numbers + units)
  - Divide quantities by recipe serving size (recipe.servings || recipe.yield || 4)
  - Handle different quantity formats: "2 cups", "1/2 tablespoon", "3-4 pieces"
  - Preserve non-quantified ingredients: "salt to taste", "fresh herbs"
  - Update ingredient display in both recipe modal and meal planning interfaces
  - Add small note: "Amounts shown per serving" for clarity
- **Code Areas Affected**:
  - `meal-planning.js`: Recipe modal ingredient rendering
  - `explore-recipes.js`: Recipe card and modal ingredient display
  - Both ingredient parsing and display logic
- **Priority**: 🟡 Medium (improves user experience and practical usability)
- **User Benefit**: Easier meal preparation and grocery shopping, especially for single-person cooking

### Frontend: Nutrition System Enhancement
- **Issue**: **PARTIALLY COMPLETED** - Nutrition display and calculation improvements
- **Recent Progress**:
  - **✅ Unified Nutrition Display**: Both explore-recipes and meal-planning now show consistent 12 nutrition fields with icons
  - **✅ Senior-Friendly Interface**: Large fonts, high contrast, touch-optimized nutrition cards
  - **✅ CSS Consistency**: Unified styling between nutrition modals across pages
  - **✅ Core Nutrition Focus**: Simplified to 12 essential nutrients for seniors (removed sodium)
- **Remaining Tasks**:
  - Unify underlying nutrition calculation functions between pages
  - Implement consistent caching strategy for both pages
  - Add better ingredient matching and estimation algorithms
- **Priority**: 🟡 Medium (display layer completed, calculation layer needs unification)

## 🟡 MEDIUM PRIORITY (Important Improvements)

### Frontend: LocalStorage Error Handling

- **Issue**: localStorage operations missing try-catch blocks
- **Impact**: App crashes in privacy mode or when storage quota exceeded
- **Fix**: Create safe localStorage wrapper functions
- **Priority**: 🟡 Medium

### Backend: Performance Optimization

- **Issue**: recipes-api uses table scan operations instead of GSI queries
- **Impact**: Slow response times for large datasets
- **Fix**: Implement GSI queries for title search optimization
- **Priority**: 🟡 Medium

## 🟢 LOW PRIORITY (Nice to Have)

### Backend: Monitoring & Metrics

- **Issue**: No performance monitoring or error tracking
- **Fix**: Add CloudWatch metrics and error monitoring
- **Priority**: 🟢 Low

### Frontend: State Management

- **Issue**: Inconsistent state management across pages
- **Fix**: Implement centralized state management system
- **Priority**: 🟢 Low

### Backend: Caching Layer

- **Issue**: No caching for frequent queries
- **Fix**: Add Redis or DynamoDB DAX caching
- **Priority**: 🟢 Low

### Frontend: Meal Planning Questionnaire Reset

- **Issue**: Users who leave meal planning page and return should have a clean questionnaire experience
- **Impact**: Old form data persists which may confuse users or lead to outdated meal plans
- **Current Behavior**:
  - User preferences are saved in localStorage and persist when returning to meal planning
  - Form inputs remain filled with previous selections
  - Users may not realize they need to review/update their preferences
- **Proposed Solution**:
  - Clear all meal planning form data when users navigate away from meal planning page
  - Reset questionnaire to Step 1 with empty inputs when returning
  - Show welcome message indicating fresh questionnaire start
  - Optionally provide "Load Previous Preferences" button for power users
- **Technical Implementation**:
  - Add beforeunload event listener to clear meal planning localStorage data
  - Reset currentStep to 1 and clear userPreferences object on page entry
  - Update loadUserPreferences() to skip loading for fresh starts
  - Consider adding user preference toggle for this behavior
- **Priority**: 🟢 Low (pending discussion with instructor about user experience approach)
- **User Benefit**: Particularly helpful for elderly users who may be confused by pre-filled forms
